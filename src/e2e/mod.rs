//! The windowed end-to-end render-test harness (`e2e-render-test.md`).
//!
//! A single deterministic invocation — `cargo run --bin e2e_render` — that
//! boots the **real** `DefaultPlugins` + `WinitPlugin` windowed app (the same
//! wiring as `main.rs`, via the shared [`crate::build_app`]), runs the render
//! graph for a fixed frame budget, reads the on-screen window's framebuffer
//! back, runs region/statistic assertions plus a `PipelineCache` error scan,
//! and exits 0 on success / non-zero on failure.
//!
//! It exists to catch WGSL/shader/naga-oil/pipeline/bind-group errors that
//! `cargo build`/`cargo test` miss — those compile only at runtime. It
//! **replaces the open-ended live smoke-run** as the verification step for this
//! project's impl agents (`e2e-render-test.md` §10): the run is bounded and
//! self-terminating, so the agent runs it *once* and reads the exit code — no
//! rebuild→rerun loop.
//!
//! Module layout (`e2e-render-test.md` §9):
//! - [`driver`] — the bounded-frame state-machine system + the `AppExit` write.
//! - [`readback`] — `Screenshot::primary_window()` + the capture observer.
//! - [`checks`] — the batch-agnostic `PipelineCache` scan + node-dispatch check.
//! - [`framebuffer`] — the format-aware `Framebuffer` wrapper + region helpers.
//! - [`gates`] — the per-batch region gates, the camera pose, `CURRENT_BATCH`.

/// alternative; see `checks.rs` module docs). The `AppExit` the runner returns
/// is therefore already the complete verdict.

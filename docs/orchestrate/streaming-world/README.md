# streaming-world — procedural generation + sliding-window residency

Orchestration topic. Goal: implement procedural voxel-world generation with a
sliding-window residency layer that streams chunks into a fixed-VRAM budget,
laying groundwork for large/infinite coordinate systems and a future streamable
sparse-voxel world format (`.vox`, Minecraft conversions). **This session
scope:** procedural-noise generation feeding the sliding window. Pre-made-world
import is out of scope but the design must not preclude it.

## Mode

**Distributed.** Renderer-touching, high blast radius, design-approval gate
needed before code lands. Per Step 2.5: criteria 1 (bounded context), 3 (low
blast radius), 4 (tight design↔impl coupling) all fail for this work →
consolidated mode disqualified.

- [x] 03a — Phase-1 impl: WGSL FastNoiseLite port (`general-purpose` → code + `03a-impl-wgsl-noise.md`)
- [x] **Hard gate (Phase 1)** — user confirmed, Phase 2 OQ.1/OQ.3 + composition scope resolved
- [x] 03b — Phase-2 impl: residency + noise_terrain.wgsl + W5 gate inversion + --streaming-window gate (`general-purpose` → code + `03b-impl-residency.md`)
- [ ] **Hard gate (Phase 2)** — submit impl to user; one camera-translation gap surfaced
- [x] 03c — Diagnostic: read-only investigation of skybox-only false-pass + minutes-long hang
- [x] **Hard gate (diagnostic)** — user directive: verify noise→visible-terrain in a static scene FIRST, then sliding window
- [x] 03d — Phase-2.4: static-scene noise verification — one-shot noise_terrain dispatch over full world + strict `--noise-static-world` gate (no residency)
- [x] **Hard gate (Phase 2.4)** — GREEN: viability YES (lum variance 1816, screenshot has visible terrain). Sliding-window bug is provably isolated to residency layer.
- [x] 03e — Phase-2.5 partial: `Generating → Resident` transition ✓ + strict gate thresholds ✓ + wall-clock budget ✓ + doc cleanup ✓
- [x] **Hard gate (Phase 2.5)** — strict gate correctly FAILS sky-only output (variance 222 vs floor 800); SECONDARY defect surfaced — slot-to-world geometric mapping
- [x] 02c — Phase-2.6 design: `WindowedSlotMap` primitive (pool + mapping + indirection table) — design at `02c-design-windowed-slot-map.md`
- [ ] **Hard gate (Phase 2.6 design)** — submit refined design to user before impl dispatch
- [x] 03f — Phase-2.6 impl: `WindowedSlotMap` data structure + GPU indirection buffer + shader helper threading (per `02c` § G migration plan)
- [x] **Hard gate (Phase 2.6 impl)** — GREEN: `--streaming-window` PASS at pixel-Δ 83 (floor 3) / variance 2326 (floor 800); all 7 gates green; visible sliding-window streaming verified for the first time
- [x] 02d/03h — Phase-2.7 consolidated: CLI + e2e re-arch — `bevy-naadf` accepts every `AppArgs` flag via clap; `e2e_render` collapsed 425→215 LOC to drive the actual main; per-gate `apply_<gate>_defaults()` overlays; `--help` prints clap output
- [x] **Hard gate (Phase 2.7)** — GREEN: all 5 priority gates pass; 3 interactive presets launch; 253 tests pass; 2 HIGH-RISK escalations noted (vox-gpu-oracle subprocess respawn, oasis-edit-visual / vox-gpu-construction default-fidelity)
- [x] 03i — Phase-2.8: deferred-idle-flush for bounds-chain dispatch — cold-start dropped ~40 s → 1.02 s (vs static baseline 5.14 s). No shader changes, ~75 LOC.
- [x] **Hard gate (Phase 2.8)** — GREEN: all 8 gates pass; cold-start now FASTER than static baseline; streaming preset visibly populates within ~1 s
- [x] 03j/03k — Phase-2.9: diagnostic + fix for camera-nudge endless-reposition loop — new `CameraAbsolutePosition` resource + production pin (FreeCamera writes absolute coords; pin derives Transform); `--gate streaming-window` refactored to drive `AppConfig::windowed()` + simulated additive Transform input (catches divergent-App-construction regressions per the e2e-must-drive-actual-main memory)
- [x] **Hard gate (Phase 2.9)** — GREEN: all 7 gates pass; production camera path now exercised by `--gate streaming-window` at pixel-Δ 82.11 / variance 2346.83 / origin-shift 4; interactive boot smoke confirms no endless reposition loop
- [x] 03l/03m — Phase-2.10: diagnostic + fix for steady-state hitch + view-distance corruption — per-affected-segment bounds dispatch every admission frame (300ms→27ms max per-frame); W3 chunk-level AADF restored on streaming (one-shot regime-1 seed after first admission); EMPTY_SLOT semantic documented; `max_ray_steps_primary` 120→240 streaming-only safety belt; new per-frame timing + mid-walk visibility assertions in `--gate streaming-window`
- [x] **Hard gate (Phase 2.10)** — GREEN gates, but visual bug not closed (user still saw skipped-chunk artifacts)
- [x] 03n/03o — Phase-2.11: segment-aware W3 attempt (Path A) → backed out → W3 disabled by default (Path B); clear_buffer for evicted slots; tautological streaming-aadf-parity gate added (compares zero-vs-zero by construction); divergence shipped without faithful-port docs entry
- [x] **Hard gate (Phase 2.11)** — GREEN gates, but parity gate confirmed tautological, visual bug not closed
- [x] 03p/02e/03q — Phase-2.12: framebuffer-diff gate added (threshold relaxed 0.7→0.05); clear-on-bind landed (MUST-1); W3 re-enable ATTEMPTED + BACKED OUT (architectural blocker — no AADF shrink mechanism); alignment-gap docs entry added (conditional)
- [ ] **Hard gate (Phase 2.12)** — MIXED: clear-on-bind landed; W3 re-enable failed; framebuffer-diff gate threshold at 0.05 is itself suspect; user must evaluate manually before further dispatches
- [x] 03r/03s — Phase-2.13: cold-start admission-race fix. Diagnostic `03r-diagnosis-cold-start-gap.md` traced the visible cold-start gap to `process_pending_admissions`'s premature `dispatched_once.insert(slot)` firing before the render-world producer node's 11+ early-returns clear; impl `03s-impl-cold-start-fix.md` deferred the insert via a cross-world ACK accumulator (`PENDING_DISPATCHED_ONCE_SLOTS`, mirrors Phase 2.12's clear-on-bind shape), added a content-checking `--gate streaming-cold-start` e2e gate that walks the camera-row segments' chunks_buffer + indirection snapshots, removed the per-admission `clear_buffer` (now redundant), and added a `warn_once!` on missing WorldGpu. All 14 camera-row segments now have non-empty content post-cold-start.
- [x] **Hard gate (Phase 2.13)** — GREEN: `--gate streaming-cold-start` PASS (14/14 camera-row segments non-empty); `--gate oasis-edit-visual` regression catcher PASS; build + unit tests pass (modulo 9 PRE-EXISTING `windowed_slot_map` failures, unrelated, deferred to a separate diagnostic)
- [x] 04 / 04b — Phase-2.14.a/.b: primitive audit + `WindowedSlotMap` atomic-API collapse. Audit at [`04-audit-primitives.md`](./04-audit-primitives.md) identified the 9 `windowed_slot_map` failures as a single I2-invariant violation (the audit ignored the in-flight state between `allocate`+`bind` and `unbind`+`free`). Impl at [`04b-impl-wsm-atomic-api.md`](./04b-impl-wsm-atomic-api.md) collapsed the four-method API to two atomic methods (`allocate_and_bind(world_seg)`, `free_segment(world_seg)`) + a callback-based `set_origin`; closes the design hole permanently. residency_driver Pass 1 + Pass 3 callers updated (5 lines per the user's Q&A note). 9 failing tests rewritten to the new surface; 2 new invariant tests added. Phase 2.14.c/.d/.e/.f/.g remain queued (compute_window_delta extraction, StreamingDiagnostics surface, composition tests, production logging, e2e gate regression run).
- [x] **Hard gate (Phase 2.14.b)** — GREEN: `cargo build --workspace` ok; `cargo test --workspace --lib windowed_slot_map` 21/21 PASS (was 11/20); full lib suite 263/263 PASS.
- [x] 04c — Phase-2.14.c: extract `compute_window_delta` primitive into new `streaming/sliding_window.rs` module. Pure-compute over `WorldSegmentPos` / `IVec3` / `HashSet` (no Bevy world, no GPU types, no `&mut state`). Audit identified the "old vs new origin → (evict, admit)" computation was split between `WindowedSlotMap::set_origin` (evict half) and `residency_driver` Pass 2 (admit half, three nested `for lz/ly/lx` loops). Implementation chose **Option A** (Pass 2 admit replacement only; `set_origin` API unchanged from 2.14.b) — preserves all 21 windowed_slot_map tests verbatim, avoids reshuffling the just-landed 2.14.b API surface. Iteration order (X-fastest) explicitly pinned + tested. 6 new unit tests cover identity / translation / disjointness / closure / full-shift / partial-diagonal-shift. See [`04c-impl-sliding-window-primitive.md`](./04c-impl-sliding-window-primitive.md).
- [x] **Hard gate (Phase 2.14.c)** — GREEN: `cargo build --workspace` ok; `cargo test --workspace --lib sliding_window` 6/6 PASS; full lib suite 269/269 PASS (== 263 + 6 new); `windowed_slot_map` subset 21/21 still PASS (behaviour preservation verified).
- [x] 04d — Phase-2.14.d: `StreamingDiagnostics` analytical surface. Addresses the user's "system must know if it HAS unfulfilled slots in the middle at startup, not via screenshots" requirement. Adds `pub struct StreamingDiagnostics { 12 fields }` + three methods on `Residency` (`diagnostics()` full snapshot, `slot_counters()` cheap O(1) tuple, `unfulfilled_camera_window_segments()` analytical scan) + two free functions in `noise_dispatch` (`pending_clear_on_bind_count`, `pending_dispatch_ack_count`) exposing the cross-world accumulator depths. Iteration order matches the existing X-fastest convention. Used the existing `Residency::frame_counter` field (no schedule touch needed). 8 new unit tests cover empty / fully-fulfilled / partial-bind / set-origin-window / hot-path-consistency / window-bound invariants + the two cross-world accumulator depth readers (serialized via a `CROSS_WORLD_ACC_TEST_GUARD: StdMutex<()>`). **Strict scope** — no `info!`/`warn!` lines, no startup-time check system, no plugin extension, no e2e rewiring (those are Phase 2.14.f). See [`04d-impl-streaming-diagnostics.md`](./04d-impl-streaming-diagnostics.md).
- [x] **Hard gate (Phase 2.14.d)** — GREEN: `cargo build --workspace` ok; `cargo test --workspace --lib streaming::residency` 21/21 PASS (13 pre-existing + 8 new); full lib suite 277/277 PASS (== 269 + 8 new, exactly the budget).
- [x] 04e — Phase-2.14.e: composition tests (synthetic-trace integration). Drives the now-isolated primitives (`WindowedSlotMap` atomic API + `compute_window_delta` + `Residency` ACK tracking + `StreamingDiagnostics`) together against synthetic camera-walk traces via a pure-data `simulate_frame` harness that mirrors `residency_driver`'s four passes — no Bevy `App`, no GPU buffer, no render world. Uses production `Residency` directly (no test stand-in needed). New `streaming/composition_tests.rs` module (~582 LOC, `#[cfg(test)]`-gated). 6 trace tests cover cold-start convergence (T1) / post-cold-start steady-state (T2) / shift-and-drain X-walk (T3) / **2.13 cold-start race regression catcher** in pure-data form (T4, simulates `ack_quota = 0` for 5 frames then catches up — pre-fix would have permanently burned slots, post-fix converges) / shift-and-drain diagonal walk (T5) / LCG-driven bounded random walk (T6, deterministic seed `0xC0FF_EE42`). All assertions include frame number + camera position + first-5-unfulfilled-segments for diagnostic specificity. See [`04e-impl-composition-tests.md`](./04e-impl-composition-tests.md).
- [x] **Hard gate (Phase 2.14.e)** — GREEN: `cargo build --workspace` ok; `cargo test --workspace --lib composition_tests` 6/6 PASS; full lib suite 283/283 PASS (== 277 + 6 new, exactly the budget).
- [x] 04f — Phase-2.14.f: production logging wiring. Connects the analytical `StreamingDiagnostics` surface to the running app via three log channels: (1) **extended per-shift `info!`** at `residency.rs:~670` now includes `cold_start_complete`, `unfulfilled`, `in_flight` (regression sentinel), `dispatched_once`; (2) **periodic `Last`-stage `info!` heartbeat** every 10 frames pre cold-start, every 300 frames steady-state — answers the user's "system must know if it HAS unfulfilled slots in the middle at startup, not via screenshots" requirement on every cold-start frame; (3) **one-shot `warn!`** at frame 500 if `unfulfilled > 0` (the analytical version of "user sees a sky-coloured hole at startup"). New free-function `should_log_at_frame` + `StreamingDiagnosticsLoggerState` resource (cold-start-complete latch + warn-latch). Three new constants `COLD_START_LOG_INTERVAL_FRAMES=10`, `STEADY_LOG_INTERVAL_FRAMES=300`, `COLD_START_WARN_THRESHOLD_FRAMES=500` introduced inline at top of `streaming/mod.rs` (no `streaming/constants.rs` — too small to justify a new file). SSoT audit: no pre-existing equivalents found. 6 new unit tests cover cadence math (3 shape-A predicate tests) + system state-machine latches (3 shape-B `App`-driven tests). See [`04f-impl-production-wiring.md`](./04f-impl-production-wiring.md).
- [x] **Hard gate (Phase 2.14.f)** — GREEN: `cargo build --workspace` ok; `cargo test --workspace --lib streaming::diagnostics_logger` 6/6 PASS; full lib suite 289/289 PASS (== 283 + 6 new, exactly the budget).

## Q&A decisions

### Step 4 (initial)

| Question | Choice |
|---|---|
| Coordinate widening | Residency-only `i32` widening — GPU bind layout stays `(cx:11,cy:10,cz:11)` window-local |
| Residency unit | Per-segment (16×16×16 chunks) |
| Block dedup | Per-resident-chunk-local |
| Noise backend | ~~`voxel_noise` CPU~~ → **WGSL FastNoiseLite port (Plan B)** — see addendum below |

### Plan-B addendum (post-design redirect)

User redirected at the design hard gate after seeing the architect's CPU-noise
choice (D.2). Throughput analysis showed GPU noise is ~30–100× faster per
segment, which directly addresses the "empty patches under fast traversal"
failure mode (D.7) the architect named as Plan A's cost. The brief explicitly
prioritises fast traversal of large worlds.

**New plan:**
- **Noise:** port `FastNoiseLite.glsl`
  (https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite/blob/master/GLSL/FastNoiseLite.glsl)
  to WGSL. GLSL chosen over HLSL because built-in name parity (`mix` / `fract`
  / `inverseSqrt`) and the absence of HLSL preprocessor / `static` / `cbuffer`
  / `register` baggage cuts the porting diff by half.
- **GPU producer:** noise WGSL feeds the existing W5 GPU pipeline
  (`ModelData → chunks/blocks/voxels`). W5 stops being dead code in the
  streaming preset — it becomes the primary consumer.
- **Driver:** the W5 once-at-startup gate is **inverted to per-frame**
  (newly-resident segments dispatch generator+chunk_calc on demand) — NOT
  disabled as in Plan A's D.10.
- **Order of work:** **WGSL noise port goes first** (user directive). It is a
  self-contained, independently verifiable deliverable (CPU↔GPU oracle test).
  The residency layer comes after, consuming it.

Impl scope estimate revised: ~1500–2000 new LOC (most of it shader). The
`voxel_noise` crate stays in the workspace as the CPU oracle source but is
**not** wired into `bevy_naadf` as a runtime dep for the streaming preset.

The Q1/Q2/Q3 choices above are unchanged.

### Scope amplifier (post-Q2 confirmation, applies to Phase 1)

User directive after confirming the Plan B design:

> "we dont have to port all of the fastnoiselite controls, but all of its
> features - yes. we'd like to have a chefs kitchen of tools so that we can
> mix&match a beautiful fast 3d voxel noise generator for our world, extended
> with biome types and complex merges and stuff"

**Overrides architect decision D.B2** (which scoped Phase 1 to
`OpenSimplex2 + Perlin + FBM` only).

**New Phase 1 scope:** port the **full FastNoiseLite feature surface** —
every noise family, every fractal type, every domain-warp variant, every
cellular distance/return-type combination. **Controls** can be simplified:
runtime-configurable via a unified uniform struct that exposes the essential
parameters; no need to mirror FastNoiseLite's C++-style getter/setter
pattern. The shader exposes a unified `fnl_get_noise_3d(state, x, y, z) -> f32`
dispatcher that internally branches on `state.noise_type` + `state.fractal_type`
+ `state.domain_warp_type` (same shape as the GLSL).

**Functions in scope for Phase 1 (full list from `FastNoiseLite.glsl`):**

- **Noise families:** OpenSimplex2 (`_fnlSingleOpenSimplex23D`), OpenSimplex2S
  (`_fnlSingleOpenSimplex2S3D`), Cellular (`_fnlSingleCellular3D`), Perlin
  (`_fnlSinglePerlin3D`), Value-Cubic (`_fnlSingleValueCubic3D`), Value
  (`_fnlSingleValue3D`). All 2D variants too if the GLSL has them (note the
  user-facing API is 3D-first for voxels; 2D ports are a nice-to-have).
- **Fractal types:** FBm (`_fnlGenFractalFBM3D`), Ridged (`_fnlGenFractalRidged3D`),
  PingPong (`_fnlGenFractalPingPong3D`), the plain "fractal off"
  pass-through.
- **Domain warps:** OpenSimplex2 (`_fnlSingleDomainWarpOpenSimplex2`),
  OpenSimplex2Reduced, BasicGrid. Each composes with the FBm / Independent
  fractal types per the GLSL function table.
- **Cellular configurations:** all distance functions (`Euclidean`, `EuclideanSq`,
  `Manhattan`, `Hybrid`) × all return types (`CellValue`, `Distance`, `Distance2`,
  `Distance2Add`, `Distance2Sub`, `Distance2Mul`, `Distance2Div`).
- **Hash + gradient tables:** all `_fnlHash`, `_fnlGradCoord*` helpers + the
  `RAND_VECS_3D` / `GRADIENTS_3D` / `RAND_VECS_2D` / `GRADIENTS_2D` constants
  the algorithms depend on.

**Phase 1 oracle test (D.B3) scope expands accordingly:** the
`--wgsl-noise-oracle` gate exercises every noise family × every fractal type
× a representative subset of domain-warps + cellular configs at fixed sample
points. Bit-near-equal (`< 1e-5`) against the Rust CPU oracle for every
combination.

**Phase 1 LOC estimate revised:** shader ~2000–2500 LOC (was ~1000), CPU
oracle ~600–800 LOC (was ~300), GPU oracle test harness ~200 LOC, e2e gate
~100 LOC. Total Phase 1 ~2900–3600 LOC, ~2.2× the architect's narrow-scope
estimate. Phase 2 unchanged at ~960 LOC.

**What "chef's kitchen" implies for the API shape:** the unified uniform
struct carries the noise-graph configuration. Future biome/composition work
will read multiple `FnlState`s and combine their outputs (lerp, max, masked
blend, etc.). The unified dispatcher is the primitive; the composition
layer is out of scope this session but the API must enable it (multiple
`FnlState` uniforms or a flat array of them).

### Phase 2 design refinements (post-Phase-1 hard-gate Q&A)

After Phase 1 landed and the user confirmed, three Phase-2 questions were
resolved via Step-4-shape Q&A:

| Question | Choice |
|---|---|
| OQ.1 — Noise → solid/empty classification | **Height-relative (Minecraft-style)** — `noise(x,y,z) + (sea_level - world_y) / amplitude > 0 → solid`. Produces ground + rolling hills + caves. `noise_terrain.wgsl` carries `sea_level: f32` + `terrain_amplitude: f32` uniforms in addition to `FnlState`. CLI knobs: `--sea-level` (default at half world-height in voxels) + `--terrain-amplitude` (default architect-picks-a-reasonable-value, justify in `03b-impl-residency.md`). |
| Composition scope (new question) | **Single FnlState noise only** in Phase 2. One noise call per voxel, single classification, single palette assignment. Multi-noise biome composition (terrain + caves + biome temperature/humidity) is deferred to a Phase 3 follow-up. The WGSL primitives from Phase 1 already support it — Phase 3 is a localised edit. |
| OQ.3 — Bounds-chain refresh policy on user edits | **Inherit existing W2 edit behavior.** Streaming admissions / evictions re-run the full bounds chain (per D.B7); user brush edits do NOT (matches existing `world_change.wgsl` path). No edits to W2 in Phase 2. |

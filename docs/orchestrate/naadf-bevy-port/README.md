# Orchestration: NAADF → Bevy Port

**Topic slug:** `naadf-bevy-port`
**Started:** 2026-05-14
**Mode:** `/delegate` — orchestrator scopes/briefs/synthesizes; all work is dispatched to sub-agents.

## Goal (one line)

Port the NAADF C#/MonoGame voxel global-illumination engine (`/mnt/archive4/DEV/NAADF`)
into Rust/Bevy at `/mnt/archive4/DEV/bevy-naadf`, informed by the research doc
`docs/research/ulschmid-2026-naadf-voxel-gi.md`. Scope: core engine (voxel + AADF + world +
render), no editor GUI / persistence / importers.

| `08-review-a2.md` | `review` group | Phase A-2 (TAA) verification — faithful-port + 0.25-spp-readiness (sample-count signal) |
| `09-design-b.md` | `design` group | Phase B (GI) architecture design |
| `design-exploration-qa.md` | orchestrator | methodology/capability/VRAM Q&A reference (lineage, PBR texturing, dynamic entities, microvoxels, LOD, TAA-history VRAM lever) — read before scoping features it covers; holds one binding decision (§6) |

**Phase B is being done in a git worktree:** `/mnt/archive4/DEV/bevy-naadf/.claude/worktrees/phase-b-gi` (branch `feat/phase-b-gi`, from `main` at the Phase-A-2-close commit). All Phase-B orchestrate files, briefs, and code use absolute paths under that worktree.

## Agent groups

- **`research`** — Reads the NAADF C# tree + the research doc. Produces a structured porting
  reference: every in-scope subsystem, its data types, its algorithms, its shaders, and a
  first-pass note on the Bevy/Rust equivalent. Writes to `02-research.md`.
- **`design`** — Consumes `01-context.md` + `02-research.md`. Designs the Bevy architecture:
  `src/` module layout, ECS components/resources/systems, the custom render-graph plan for the
  ported WGSL pipeline, and the NAADF-subsystem → Bevy-feature mapping. Writes to `03-design.md`.
- **`impl`** — Consumes context + research + design. Executes the port in phases, runs builds.
  Writes to `04-impl.md`.
- **`review`** — Verifies the port against NAADF's source behaviour and the research paper.
  Writes to `05-review.md`.

## Phase checklist

Phase order (canonical defs in `01-context.md` §2 "Phasing decision"): **A → A-2 (TAA) →
B (GI) → C (GPU construction/editing)**. One gated phase at a time.

- [x] Step 2 — Re-implementation audit → `00-reuse-audit.md`
- [x] Step 4 — Architectural Q&A → Q1–Q4 (`01-context.md` §2)
- [x] Design-phase Q&A → D1–D5 + 4-phase restructure (`01-context.md` §2b)
- [x] Step 5 — Context files written (`README.md`, `01-context.md`)
- [x] `research` phase → `02-research.md` (whole paper + in-scope C# tree, phase-tagged, ~36 KB)
- [x] `design` phase (**Phase A**) → `03-design.md` (~33 KB; 12-step Phase-A impl sequence)
- [x] `impl` phase (**Phase A**) → `04-impl.md` — Batch 1 (steps 1–6) + Batch 2 (steps 7–12) done 2026-05-14; 39 tests pass, builds + smoke-runs clean
- [x] `review` phase (**Phase A**) → `05-review.md` — **Phase A review gate PASSED**. Two regressions found, fixed, and user-confirmed: (1) camera→ray perspective (3 compounding MonoGame↔wgpu convention bugs), (2) out-of-volume concentric-line artifacts (wrong AABB clip-box values — NAADF insets by 0.1 voxel as `float3`). 39 tests pass; builds + runs coherent inside and outside the volume.
- [x] **Phase A-2 (TAA) — COMPLETE.** Context (`01-context.md` §2c) + design (`06-design-a2.md`) + impl (all 9 steps, `07-impl-a2.md`) + review (`08-review-a2.md`): 0.25-spp readiness READY, faithful HLSL→WGSL port + `M*v` matrix convention verified, leftover step-8 instrumentation reverted, 39 tests pass, smoke-runs clean. Deliverable: NAADF's 16-frame long-term-memory TAA, on by default; per-pixel sample-count signal exposed for Phase B.
- [~] Phase B (GI) — in worktree `feat/phase-b-gi`. Context written (`01-context.md` §2d): scope = NAADF's real-time `WorldRenderBase` GI pipeline only (compressed ReSTIR GI + sparse bilateral denoiser + 4-plane first-hit + `rayQueueCalc` adaptive 0.25-spp + atmosphere); reference pathtracer + DLSS-RR explicitly OUT (future). **`design` in progress** → `09-design-b.md`; then impl → review
- [ ] Phase C (GPU construction/editing): design → impl → review

## Pacing

One dispatch at a time. After each agent returns, the orchestrator pauses and submits to the
user before the next dispatch. Each substantive dispatch is preceded by a delegated checkpoint
commit.
